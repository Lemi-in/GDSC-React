Todo App Sample
A basic To-Do app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
This app allows you to add and delete tasks, and it persists your to-do list between page reloads using local storage.

Features
Add Todo: Input a task and click "Add" to add it to your to-do list.
Delete Todo: Each task comes with a "Delete" button to remove it from the list.
Persistence: Your to-do list is saved in your browser's local storage, so it persists even if you refresh the page.
